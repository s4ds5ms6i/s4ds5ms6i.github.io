### ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I'm Shahram Shobeiri, a software engineer with years of experience. My journey began in technical high school and continued through university, all while working in the industry. I spent most of my career in the Microsoft ecosystem (.NET), and in recent years, Iâ€™ve shifted to using Go and working with microservice architectures.

I recently launched a YouTube channel to share educational content about software engineeringâ€”drawing from my real-world experience in building scalable systems.
